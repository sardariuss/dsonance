# FAQ

**Q: What is the purpose of Dsonance?**\
**A:** Dsonance aims to establish a real-time and decentralized view of community consensus on a variety of topics. By incentivizing genuine participation, the platform ensures that the consensus authentically reflects the collective perspective.

***

**Q: How does consensus evolve over time?**\
**A:** Consensus evolves dynamically with each new ballot cast. It is weighted by the decay of locked tokens, meaning newer ballots have greater influence than older ones. This mechanism ensures the consensus stays adaptable and reflective of the most recent opinions.

***

**Q: What happens to my locked tokens after the lock duration?**\
**A:** Once the lock duration ends, your original tokens are always fully returned (minus 0.02 USDT as transfer fee). You also get extra USDT on top, based on that ballot APY.

***

**Q: How is my ballot APY computed?**\
**A:** The ballot APY depends on several factors. The first factor, which is independant to the ballot, is the borrowing utilization rate (how much is borrowed compared to how much is supplied in the protocol). The other factors are the ballot dissent (fixed at time of casting), ballot consent at the moment the ballot is unlocked, and the duration lock of the ballot. It is explained in details in the [Voting rewards](protocol-beta-version/lock-rewards.md) chapter.

***

**Q: I didn’t plan for my lock duration to increase so much. Is there anything I can do to unlock it?**\
**A:** Unfortunately, once a lock is placed, its duration cannot be manually reduced or undone. The increasing duration is a key part of the protocol’s design, ensuring that sufficient time is allowed for the truth to emerge on important topics.

***

**Q: I am sure most consensuses do not reflect the actual opinion. Can I contact a moderator to change them?**\
**A:** Each consensus is determined by the collective votes of the participants and evolves over time based on the active input of the community. Since the platform is decentralized, there is no moderator who can alter the consensus. However, you are always welcomed to participate and cast your vote to help shape the consensus in line with your perspective.

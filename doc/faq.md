# FAQ

**Q: What is the purpose of Dsonance?**\
**A:** Dsonance aims to establish a precise and decentralized view of community consensus on a variety of topics. By incentivizing genuine participation, the platform ensures that the consensus authentically reflects the collective perspective.

***

**Q: How does consensus evolve over time?**\
**A:** Consensus evolves dynamically with each new ballot cast. It is weighted by the decay of locked Bitcoin, meaning newer ballots have greater influence than older ones. This mechanism ensures the consensus stays adaptable and reflective of the most recent opinions.

***

**Q: What happens to my locked Bitcoin after the lock duration?**\
**A:** Once the lock duration ends, your Bitcoin is fully returned, minus a nominal fee of 20 sats (approximately 0.02 USD at the time of writing).

***

**Q: How are rewards distributed?**\
**A:** Rewards are divided into participation rewards, distributed continuously during the lock period, and discernment rewards, which are granted at the end of a lock based on how well your vote aligns with the consensus and its minority positioning.

***

**Q: I didn’t plan for my lock duration to increase so much. Is there anything I can do to unlock it?**\
**A:** Unfortunately, once a lock is placed, its duration cannot be manually reduced or undone. The increasing duration is a key part of the protocol’s design, ensuring that sufficient time is allowed for the truth to emerge on important topics. However, you will continue to receive participation rewards throughout the lock period, with potentially greater discernment rewards at its conclusion.

***

**Q: I am sure most consensuses do not reflect the actual opinion. Can I contact a moderator to change them?**\
**A:** Each consensus is determined by the collective votes of the participants and evolves over time based on the active input of the community. Since the platform is decentralized, there is no moderator who can alter the consensus. However, you are encouraged to participate and cast your vote to help shape the consensus in line with your perspective.

# Lock rewards

In its initial phase, the protocol rewards voters with **Dsonance tokens**, a fixed amount of which is minted daily. These rewards are divided into two parts: one portion incentivizes participation in the protocol, while the larger portion rewards voter discernment.

**Participation Rewards**\
Participation rewards are distributed **continuously throughout the active period of a lock**. The amount each voter receives is proportional to the amount of Bitcoin in their lock relative to the total Bitcoin locked in the protocol.

**Discernment Rewards**\
Discernment rewards are distributed **at the end of a lock**. The voterâ€™s reward depends on how well their ballot choice aligns with the current consensus and the extent to which their choice represented a minority opinion at the time of casting. Stronger alignment with consensus and bolder minority positions yield greater rewards.

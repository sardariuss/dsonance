# Introduction

**Dsonance** is a modular platform hosting **real-time consensus**, each **tied 1:1 to a DAO**. Members stake their DAO‚Äôs token (e.g. ICP for the NNS) to **vote on empirical statements**. By harnessing the power of the **Proof-of-Foresight**, the platform ensures that consensus remains **genuine**, adapts in **real-time** to shifts in public opinion, and **resists manipulation**.

#### üéØ **Goals**

* **Capture consensus nuances**: Represent consensus as probabilities, rather than binary outcomes, for greater accuracy and flexibility.
* **Incentivize authenticity**: Reward skilled participants who contribute genuine, thoughtful opinions.
* **Combat bribery**: Ensure decisions remain immune to external financial influence, a timeless issue in human decision-making.
* **Value user attention**: Incentivize participants to vote on topics they are most knowledgeable about, so not everyone is required to vote on every issue, improving focus and engagement.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Proof-of-Foresight**

* **Stake-weighted voting:** Lock your DAO‚Äôs coins to vote on community-specific statements, with influence tied to your stake.
* **Dynamic lock duration:** Lock durations adjust to each ballot and extend over time as topics gain popularity.
* **Earn twice:** Earn DSN for your participation, plus a yield on your DAO's coins based on the accuracy of your predictions.

#### üé≤ **Game Theory**

* **Boldness is rewarded**: Minority opinions are incentivized, but the consensus must shift before their lock expires.
* **Limited whale influence**: Large stakeholders can shift consensus rapidly but face smaller rewards and longer lock durations.
* **Strategic voting**: Voting opens opportunities for opponents to respond strategically, increasing the stakes and prolonging lock durations.

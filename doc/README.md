# Towerview: The World's First Consensus Market

**Towerview** is a decentralized platform that introduces a new primitive: a **Consensus Market** — a mechanism for reaching crowd-based agreement on complex, unresolved, or empirical topics such as scientific claims, historical narratives, or public health questions.

Unlike DAOs, which coordinate action on protocol decisions, or prediction markets, which speculate on binary future outcomes, Towerview tackles questions with no fixed resolution date. Think: Did COVID-19 leak from a lab? Is keto a healthy diet?

Users stake USDT to open a position on a given claim. Each position is locked for a period determined by the popularity of the topic, allowing time for the collective signal to evolve. At the end of the lock, users receive their stake back, along with a yield — which is maximized when their position aligns with the final consensus. This is achieved through a mechanism we call **Proof of Foresight**: dissenting opinions that are later validated earn the most, incentivizing honest, forward-looking judgment.

Towerview is powered by a Bitcoin-collateralized lending system that generates real yield in the background, allowing users to participate without financial risk or loss of capital.

Towerview is unplayable, impartial, and time-driven — no moderators, no centralized resolution. Just a self-sustaining, crypto-native mechanism to coordinate belief around fuzzy, controversial, or slow-moving topics.

By filling the gap between governance and prediction, Towerview unlocks a new layer of decentralized collaboration — enabling us to ask not only what will happen or what should we do, but what do we believe is true?


#### 🎯 **Goals**

* **Capture consensus nuances**: Represent consensus as probabilities, rather than binary outcomes, for greater accuracy and flexibility.
* **Incentivize authenticity**: Reward skilled participants who contribute genuine, thoughtful opinions.
* **Combat bribery**: Ensure decisions remain immune to external financial influence, a timeless issue in human decision-making.
* **Value user attention**: Incentivize participants to open positions on topics they are most knowledgeable about, so not everyone is required to participate in every pool, improving focus and engagement.


#### ⚙️ **Proof-of-Foresight**

* **Stake-weighted positions:** Lock USDT to open positions on statements, with influence tied to your stake.
* **Dynamic lock duration:** Lock durations adjust to each position and extend over time as topics gain popularity.
* **Varying APY:** The APY on your USDT is entirely based on the accuracy of your predictions. Maximize it by being right before everybody else!


#### 🎲 **Game Theory**

* **Boldness is rewarded**: Minority opinions are incentivized, but the consensus must shift before their lock expires.
* **Limited whale influence**: Large stakeholders can shift consensus rapidly but face smaller rewards and longer lock durations.
* **Strategic positioning**: Opening positions creates opportunities for opponents to respond strategically, increasing the stakes and prolonging lock durations.

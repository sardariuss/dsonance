# Introduction

**Dsonance** is a platform that enables users to **earn yield on their Bitcoin** and **win additional rewards** by voting on a list of **empirical statements**. By harnessing the power of **Proof-of-Foresight**, the platform ensures that consensus remains **genuine**, adapts in **real-time** to shifts in public opinion, and **resists manipulation**.

#### 🎯 **Goals**

* **Capture consensus nuances**: Represent consensus as probabilities, rather than binary outcomes, for greater accuracy and flexibility.
* **Incentivize authenticity**: Reward skilled participants who contribute genuine, thoughtful opinions.
* **Combat bribery**: Ensure decisions remain immune to external financial influence, a timeless issue in human decision-making.
* **Value user attention**: Incentivize participants to vote on topics they are most knowledgeable about, so not everyone is required to vote on every issue, improving focus and engagement.

#### ⚙️ **Proof-of-Foresight**

* **Stake-weighted voting:** Users lock Bitcoin to vote on specific statements, with voting power proportional to their stake.
* **Dynamic lock duration:** Lock durations adjust to each ballot and extend over time as topics gain popularity.
* **Earn twice:** Get DSN tokens for your participation—and maximize your BTC yield with your foresight!

#### 🎲 **Game Theory**

* **Boldness is rewarded**: Minority opinions are incentivized, but the consensus must shift before their lock expires.
* **Limited whale influence**: Large stakeholders can shift consensus rapidly but face smaller rewards and longer lock durations.
* **Strategic voting**: Voting opens opportunities for opponents to respond strategically, increasing the stakes and prolonging lock durations.

# Introduction

**Resonance.defi** is a platform that enables users to lock Bitcoin and participate in a decentralized consensus system. By fostering continuous, stake-weighted voting, the platform ensures that collective decisions are nuanced, evolving, and resistant to manipulation. Participants are rewarded for their contributions and their ability to anticipate the future consensus, fostering a fair and transparent system that values foresight, genuine opinions, and strategic thinking.

#### üéØ **Goals**

* **Capture consensus nuances**: Represent consensus as probabilities, rather than binary outcomes, for greater accuracy and flexibility.
* **Incentivize authenticity**: Reward skilled participants who contribute genuine, thoughtful opinions.
* **Combat bribery**: Ensure decisions remain immune to external financial influence, a timeless issue in human decision-making.
* **Value user attention**: Incentivize participants to vote on topics they are most knowledgeable about, so not everyone is required to vote on every issue, improving focus and engagement.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

* **Stake-weighted voting**: Users lock Bitcoin to vote on specific statements, with voting power proportional to their stake.
* **Dynamic lock duration**: Lock durations are tailored to each ballot and can extend over time as the topic gains popularity.
* **Continuous voting**: Results decay over time, allowing past consensus to be re-evaluated as opinions evolve.
* **Sensible rewards**: Voters are rewarded not just for participating but for their discernment, with greater rewards given to opinions that stand the test of time.

#### üé≤ **Game Theory**

* **Boldness is rewarded**: Minority opinions are incentivized, but the consensus must shift before their lock expires.
* **Limited whale influence**: Large stakeholders can shift consensus rapidly but face smaller rewards and longer lock durations.
* **Strategic voting**: Voting opens opportunities for opponents to respond strategically, increasing the stakes and prolonging lock durations.

  The Carlson Protocol is a decentralized system designed to gauge and represent
  consensus on factual topics through collective input.

# Overview

### 🎯 Goals

* Provide an **accurate representation of the current consensus** on a variety of topics—capturing the consensus nuances as probabilities rather than binary outcomes.
* Incentivize skilled participants to **contribute genuine opinions** and avoid trolls.
* Stay **immuned to bribery**. Bribery is a timeless issue. Whenever human decisions can be influenced by money, the risk of manipulation arises.
* **Value user attention**: capturing voters' attention becomes increasingly difficult as the number or the complexity of topics grows.

### How It Works

⚖️ **Stake-weighted voting**: Users lock Bitcoins to vote on specific statements. The weight of their vote corresponds directly to the amount of Bitcoins they lock.

♾️ **Continuous voting**: Votes never end and the results decay, so that past consensus can always be re-evaluated.

🎁 **Rewards**: For now the protocol uses its own token to reward participants in order to increase the decentralization of the platform. Once all the supply is minted, participants will get rewarded in Bitcoins.

### Game Theory

🗳️ **Rewards the bold**: Minority opinions have stronger incentives to express themselves but the consensus still has to shift before their lock expires.

♟️ **Strategic voting dynamics**: Casting a vote creates opportunities for opponents to counter, but it also increases the stakes by lengthening the lock duration.

🐋 **Whale influence**: Large stakeholders can rapidly shift consensus by locking substantial amounts. However, this creates a longer window of opportunity for the opposing side to respond.

💡 **Wittgenstein’s indicator**: _"\[...] if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler"_. The protocol could feature an indicator to flag votes with either too few or too many tokens locked, signaling that such votes may not reflect a reliable consensus.

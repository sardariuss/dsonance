# Tokenomics

Dsonance operates each DAO with two tokens:

* **DAO’s Native Coin**: The native coin of the DAO.
* **DSN**: The native utility and governance token of Dsonance.

### **DAO's native coin**

Dsonance uses each DAO's native token to facilitate the redirection of empirical votes to the Dsonance community, which is specifically designed to handle such votes more effectively. The DAO’s coin serves the following functions:

* **Open new consensus votes**.
* **Participate in votes** and influence consensus.
* **Borrowing**: Can be used as collateral for borrowing DSN tokens.

### **DSN Token**

The DSN token serves as a utility and governance token for the Dsonance platform:

* **Rewards** – 58% of the token is distributed to active participants.
* **Burn Mechanism** – Required for certain platform actions, such as opening new communities or boosting vote rewards.
* **Collateral** – Used to borrow DAO's coins.
* **Governance** – Locked in neurons, enabling participation in decisions shaping the future of Dsonance.

The minting of DSN rewards follow an **exponential decay model** with a **4-year half-life**. Early users earn more, while emissions gradually decrease, ensuring long-term scarcity and sustainability.

### **DAO's Coins Yield Mechanism**

Dsonance generates yield on a DAO's native coin by allowing users to borrow the coin against their DSN holdings. The borrowed coins come from ballot-locked funds, turning voting into a decentralized lending system.

To ensure stability, the platform uses a utilization-based interest rate model, adjusting borrowing and lending rates dynamically based on supply and demand—similar to platforms like Aave and Compound. Each community is supported by a DAO token/DSN liquidity pool, allowing the protocol to sell DSN collateral when necessary to prevent insolvency.

### **Supply Dynamics & Deflationary Mechanisms**

The DSN token follows a **two-phase economic model**:

1. **Inflationary Phase** – Initially, DSN rewards will be abundant, and burn requirements will be minimal to encourage adoption.
2. **Deflationary Phase** – Over time, DSN rewards will decrease, while burning requirements will increase, leading to a progressively scarcer supply.

To reinforce this deflationary shift, 10% of all DAO coin yield generated by the platform will be used to buy back and burn DSN tokens. This ongoing reduction in supply supports long-term value appreciation and ecosystem sustainability.

#### **DSN Token Allocation**

The total supply of DSN will be **1 billion tokens** distributed as follows:

* **120 million DSN (12%) – Dev team**\
  Reserved as a **reward and incentive for the development team** for their contributions to the project.
* **160 million DSN (16%) – SNS Decentralization Swap**\
  Allocated for the SNS swap, ensuring broad community ownership and decentralized governance.
* **135 million DSN (13.5%) – Treasury**\
  Held in reserve for future initiatives, partnerships, ecosystem grants, and unforeseen needs.
* **5 million DSN (0.5%) – Airdrop**\
  A small portion dedicated to initial distribution, rewarding early adopters and fostering community engagement while minimizing the risk of excessive sell pressure.
* **580 million DSN (58%) – Mining**\
  Gradually distributed to users over time as incentives for opening votes and voting, following an **exponential halving model every four years**, ensuring long-term engagement and sustainable growth.

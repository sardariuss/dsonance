# Tokenomics

The platform uses two tokens:

* The **ckBTC token**, the wrapped version of **BTC** for the Internet Computer.
* The **DSN token**, the native **Dsonance utility and governance token**

### ckBTC token

ckBTC is a token on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** blockchain that represents **Bitcoin (BTC) in a wrapped form**. It allows users to transact BTC **quickly and cheaply** within the Internet Computer ecosystem while still being **fully backed 1:1 by real Bitcoin**.

#### **How ckBTC Works**

* **Bridged BTC**: ckBTC is backed by BTC held in a Bitcoin smart contract on the Internet Computer.
* **Fast & Low-Cost Transactions**: Unlike native Bitcoin transactions, ckBTC enables near-instant transfers with negligible fees.
* **Interoperability**: It allows smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer to interact with Bitcoin **without relying on third-party bridges**.
* **Minting & Redemption**: Users can **mint** ckBTC by depositing BTC into the IC Bitcoin canister and **redeem** it 1:1 for real BTC when needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since ckBTC is backed 1:1 by BTC and secured by chain-key cryptography, it effectively functions as BTC. Therefore, both terms are used interchangeably throughout this documentation, even though, in practice, the Dsonance platform specifically uses ckBTC.
{% endhint %}

### DSN token

The DSN token is the **native utility and governance token** of the Dsonance platform. It grants holders the power to shape the future of the platform through the **Dsonance DAO**, influencing key decisions and protocol upgrades.

DSN serves multiple functions:

* **Rewards:** Distributed to users who actively participate in the platform.
* **Burn Mechanism:** Users must burn DSN to engage in certain platform activities.
* **Collateral:** Used as collateral for borrowing BTC.

#### Supply Dynamics

The DSN tokenomics follow a **two-phase model**:

1. **Inflationary Phase** – Initially, DSN rewards will be abundant, while burn requirements remain low.
2. **Deflationary Phase** – Over time, rewards will decrease, and burning costs will rise, leading to a more scarce supply.

#### **BTC Yield Buyback & Burn**

From launch, the platform will allocate **10% of the BTC yield** it generates to **buy back and burn DSN tokens**. This continuous burn mechanism helps reduce supply, driving long-term value appreciation.

By combining **early incentives** with a **gradual shift toward scarcity**, these mechanisms encourage early adoption while empowering the long-term value growth of DSN.
